# homeData
a home data collector server for various purposes.

It is based on a raspberry pi 2b+ for now.
The repo contains the server's logic along with the edges (esp32 ..)

The server uses a Firebase database to store the data,
so you need a 'creds.json' file generated from your firebase account to reside in the server folder.
